  <h1>Discovering Novel RNA Isoforms in Mouse Brown Fat</h1>
  <p class="tagline">My bioinformatics pipeline/technical demo to uncover new RNA transcript variants using long-read RNA sequencing and as a learning tool.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2> Project Summary</h2>
    <p>
        This project analyzes a nanopore long-read RNA-seq dataset from <strong>murine (brown) brown adipose tissue</strong>
        using a reproducible FLAIR-based pipeline. I identified both known and previously unannotated (novel) isoforms and quantify their expression.
        This project also serves as a personal learning tool for an introduction to bio-informatics, focusing on basic data-analysis/pipeline.

    <h2>Pipeline Overview</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Environment Setup (Python 3.12, dependency installation, setup working env and directory)</li>
        <li><a href="../results/qc/NanoPlot-report.html"> Quality Control (NanoPlot) </a></li>
        <li>Read Alignment (minimap2)</li>
        <li>Transcript Correction (FLAIR, not the NLP one)</li>
        <li>Transcript Collapsing</li>
        <li>Quantification of Isoforms</li>
        <li>Analysis & Visualization</li>

  <div class="section">
    <h2> Results</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>11,394</strong> novel isoforms identified</li>
      <li>Highly variable expression patterns across genes</li>
      <li>Top novel isoform genes: <code>Eif4g1</code>, <code>Cd36</code>, <code>H2-K1</code></li>
      <li>Established a decent pipeline for data-analysis and learned basic genomics concepts while doing it! :)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><em>These results highlight previously unknown RNA diversity (with some admitted limitations) in metabolically active brown fat tissue.</em></p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2> Limitations</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>This project does focus more as a learning data-analysis pipeline for python, so I'll admit there are limitations and this is quite limited. </li>
        <li>I only used one sample and did not compare to publicly available RefSeq/GENCODE or any white papers, this was more of a tech demo.</li>
        <li>My reference could just be rough/incomplete.</li>
        <li>Only looked at specifically brown mouse fat.</li>
        <li>Low sensitivity could have been a possibility.</li>
        <li>I didn't really look into the context of the study, so not sure of the exact environmental context for these lil mice.</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="section">
    <h2> Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>Identifying novel isoforms can uncover new mechanisms of gene regulation, alternative splicing, and tissue-specific gene expression — especially in dynamic tissues like brown fat, which plays a role in energy metabolism.</p>

    <h2> About me! </h2>
    <p> I'm Thaddeus Lipke, a SWE/EMT-B certified grad from Columbia Uni who wanted to learn some bio-informatics and get more into python. <br>
        Feel free to contact me, I'd like to learn more if something needs clarification or corrections <strong>(please correct me)</strong>! My contact is on the <a  href="https://github.com/51talcol21/long-read-rna-mouse-brownfat" target="_blank"> github repo for this! </a> <br>
        This project helped me learn genomics tools like FLAIR, minimap2, and samtools — and apply them to a real-world RNA sequencing problem with a mouse dataset.</p>
